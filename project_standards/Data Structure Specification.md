# Data Structure Specification - Professional Website Builder

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the standard JSON data structure that will serve as the "single source of truth" for a user's portfolio. This schema will be used by the application UI for data population and editing, and by the website generator to build the final static site. A consistent data structure is critical for ensuring that themes can be applied interchangeably.

## 2. High-Level Schema

The entire portfolio will be represented by a single JSON object. This object will contain all user-provided information, organized into logical sections.

```json
{
  "profile": {},
  "contact": {},
  "workExperience": [],
  "projects": [],
  "education": [],
  "skills": [],
  "theme": {}
}
```
