# UI/UX Design Document - Professional Website Builder

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the user interface (UI) design, user experience (UX) flow, and key interactive components for the Professional Website Builder. It serves as a bridge between the abstract specifications and the final, user-facing application.

## 2. Core Design Principles

-   **Simplicity & Clarity:** The interface will be clean, modern, and uncluttered. Every screen will have a clear purpose, avoiding overwhelming the user with too many options at once.
-   **Guided Journey:** The application will guide the user through a logical, step-by-step process: Add Documents -> Edit Content -> Select Theme -> Generate.
-   **Immediate Feedback:** The UI will provide instant and clear feedback for user actions, such as confirming when a file has been successfully added, showing a loading state during processing, and celebrating the final website generation.

## 3. High-Level User Flow

The application experience is broken down into five primary stages:

1.  **Onboarding & File Ingestion:** The user launches the app and adds their professional documents.
2.  **Processing Method Selection:** The user chooses how the application should process the documents (Manually, via Cloud AI, or via Local AI).
3.  **Content Curation & Review:** Depending on the chosen tier, the user either populates the data manually or reviews and approves the data automatically populated by an AI.
4.  **Theming & Preview:** The user selects a visual theme and sees a live preview of their website.
5.  **Generation & Export:** The user initiates the build process and is given access to the final website files.

## 4. Key Screens & Components

A global `Settings` icon will be present in the main application window to allow access to the Settings screen at any time.

### Handling Non-Ideal States (Loading, Errors)

To provide a complete user experience, the UI must account for states beyond the "happy path."

-   **Global Loading State:** For long-running operations like AI processing or website generation, a modal overlay with a spinner should be displayed to prevent further user interaction.

    **Mockup: Modal Spinner**

    |          Please wait while the AI processes your documents.      |

    +------------------------------------------------------------------+
    ```

-   **Inline Error Messages:** For errors related to a specific item, like a file that cannot be parsed, the error should be displayed next to the item itself.

    ```
    +------------------------------------------------------+
    | Added Files:                                         |

    +------------------------------------------------------+
    ```

-   **Transient Notifications (Toasts):** For non-critical errors or warnings (like an unsupported file type), a short-lived notification should appear at the bottom or top of the screen and then fade away.

    **Mockup: Toast Notification**
    ```
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | ... (Main App Window) ...                                                      |

    | [!] Unsupported file type: 'archive.zip' was ignored.                          |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    ```

### Screen 1: Welcome & Processing Method Selection

-   **Purpose:** To allow for easy document aggregation and to select the desired content processing method.
-   **Layout:** A two-panel layout.
    -   **Left Panel (File Ingestion):** A large drag-and-drop zone and an "Add Files" button. Below the drop zone, a list of added files is displayed.
    -   **Right Panel (Processing Tier Selection):** This panel becomes active after at least one file is added. It contains three prominent, selectable options:
        1.  **Manual Mode:** "Take control and fill out your portfolio from the extracted text yourself."
        2.  **Cloud AI Mode:** "Let our AI automatically build your portfolio. Requires a configured API key." (This option is disabled if no API key is set in Settings).
        3.  **Local AI Mode:** "Use your own local AI to build your portfolio. Requires a configured local server endpoint." (This option is disabled if the endpoint is not set in Settings).
-   **Call to Action:** A single button at the bottom, "Process Documents". The application will proceed to the next step using the selected tier.

    -   **Left Panel (Navigation):** A vertical list of tabs for `Profile`, `Contact`, `Work Experience`, etc.
    -   **Right Panel (Form Editor):** Displays the form for the selected section.
-   **Tier-Dependent Experience:**
    -   **In Manual Mode (Tier 1):** The forms are mostly empty. The user must manually type or copy-paste information from their documents into the fields. A third panel showing the raw extracted text may be provided as a reference.
    -   **In AI Mode (Tiers 2 & 3):** The forms are pre-populated with the data generated by the AI. The user's role shifts to reviewing the content, making corrections, and approving the AI's work. The raw text reference panel is not needed.
-   **Call to Action:** A "Next: Choose Theme" button.
