# Implementation Plan - Professional Website Builder

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive, phased implementation plan for the Professional Website Builder application. The goal is to progress from the initial design and specification documents to a complete, production-ready application that fulfills all requirements outlined in the PRD.

The project will be broken down into distinct phases, allowing for iterative development, testing, and refinement.

## Prerequisites

Before starting development, the following tools must be installed and configured on the development machine:

-   **Node.js:** `v20.x` or later
-   **npm (or pnpm/yarn):** `v10.x` or later
-   **Rust:** `v1.75.x` or later (via `rustup`)
-   **Tauri CLI:** `v1.x` (to be installed globally via `cargo`)
    -   Run `cargo install tauri-cli`
-   **Platform-Specific Dependencies:** Follow the Tauri guide for setting up the development environment for your specific OS (macOS, Windows, or Linux): [https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites)

## Phase 1: Project Scaffolding & Standards (1-2 days)

This phase focuses on establishing a robust foundation for the project, including the directory structure, development environment, and coding standards.

-   [ ] **1.1. Create `project_standards` Directory:**
    -   Create a `project_standards` directory at the root of the repository.
    -   Add standard configuration files:
        -   `.editorconfig` for consistent editor settings.
        -   `prettier.config.js` and `.prettierignore` for code formatting.
        -   `eslint.config.js` for JavaScript/TypeScript linting.
        -   `clippy.toml` for Rust linting.

-   [ ] **1.2. Initialize Monorepo:**
    -   Set up an npm/pnpm/yarn workspace at the project root to manage the different sub-projects (UI, generator).

-   [ ] **1.3. Initialize Tauri Application:**
    -   Create the Tauri project, which will generate the `src-tauri` (Rust backend) and `src-ui` (React frontend) directories.
    -   Configure `tauri.conf.json` with the application's identifier and basic settings.

-   [ ] **1.4. Initialize Website Generator:**
    -   Set up the Next.js project in a `src-generator` directory. This will contain the website themes and generation logic.

-   [ ] **1.5. Version Control:**
    -   Initialize a Git repository and create the initial commit with the project structure and documentation.

## Phase 2: Tier 1 Implementation - Manual Mode (5-7 days)

This phase focuses on delivering the core functionality of the application: manual data entry and website generation.

-   [ ] **2.1. UI Component Scaffolding (React):**
    -   Build the basic React components for all five screens as defined in the UI/UX document, using the ASCII mockups as a layout guide.
    -   Implement navigation between screens.

-   [ ] **2.2. Backend File Handling (Rust):**
    -   Implement the file drag-and-drop functionality in the Tauri backend.
    -   Create a robust file-handling module to copy dropped files into the `user-data/source-files` directory.

-   [ ] **2.3. Basic Document Parsing (Rust):**
    -   Integrate Rust crates to extract raw text from:
        -   `.md` files
        -   `.docx` files
        -   `.pdf` files
    -   Create a unified function that aggregates text from all source documents.

-   [ ] **2.4. State Management (React & Tauri):**
    -   Establish communication between the React frontend and the Rust backend.
    -   The UI will send commands to the backend (e.g., "process files"), and the backend will emit events and data back to the UI (e.g., "file processing complete," aggregated text).
    -   Implement the forms in the "Main Editor" screen to capture user input, conforming to the `Data Structure Specification`.

-   [ ] **2.5. Website Generator (Next.js):**
    -   Implement the logic to pass the final JSON data from the Tauri application to the Next.js generator.
    -   Create the first website theme ("Onyx").
    -   Develop the Next.js Static Site Generation (SSG) logic to build the final HTML/CSS/JS files into the `user-data/generated-site` directory based on the input JSON.

-   [ ] **2.6. End-to-End Test (Tier 1):**
    -   Perform a full manual test: drop files, extract text, fill out forms, select the theme, and generate the website.

## Phase 3: Tier 2 & 3 Implementation - AI Integration (4-6 days)

This phase introduces the AI-powered automation features.

-   [ ] **3.1. UI for Settings Screen (React):**
    -   Build the complete Settings screen UI, including tabs and input fields for Cloud API keys and the Local LLM endpoint.

-   [ ] **3.2. Secure Credential Storage (Rust):**
    -   Integrate a crate like `tauri-plugin-keychain` to securely store and retrieve user-provided API keys from the OS's native secret manager.

-   [ ] **3.3. LLM API Client (Rust):**
    -   Use the `reqwest` crate to build a generic HTTP client for communicating with REST APIs.
    -   Implement the specific logic for making requests to Cloud LLM providers (Tier 2) and a local LLM server (Tier 3).

-   [ ] **3.4. Prompt Engineering & Data Validation (Rust):**
    -   Develop a robust prompt that instructs the LLM to analyze the aggregated text and return a JSON object that strictly adheres to the `Data Structure Specification`.
    -   Implement a validation layer that checks the LLM's JSON output for correctness and completeness before passing it to the UI.

-   [ ] **3.5. Update Main Editor UI (React):**
    -   Modify the "Main Editor" screen to handle the AI-driven workflow. When the user selects an AI tier, the forms will be pre-populated with the validated JSON from the backend, making the user a reviewer.

-   [ ] **3.6. End-to-End Test (Tiers 2 & 3):**
    -   Test the full flow for both Cloud and Local LLM modes. Verify API key handling, data generation, and the review process.

## Phase 4: Theming & Finalization (3-4 days)

This phase focuses on completing the user-facing features and polishing the application.

-   [ ] **4.1. Implement Remaining Website Themes (Next.js):**
    -   Develop the four additional website themes as planned. Ensure each theme is self-contained and customizable.

-   [ ] **4.2. Implement Theme Picker & Preview (React):**
    -   Build the "Theme Selection" screen UI.
    -   Implement the live preview functionality. An `iframe` pointing to a locally served, temporarily generated site is a viable approach.

-   [ ] **4.3. Build & Packaging:**
    -   Configure the Tauri build process to create distributable application bundles for macOS (`.app`, `.dmg`) and Windows (`.msi`).
    -   Test the installers and the installed applications on both platforms.

-   [ ] **4.4. Final UI/UX Polish:**
    -   Review the entire application for consistency, clarity, and ease of use.
    -   Add loading indicators, success messages, and clear error handling to create a smooth user experience.

## Phase 5: Testing & Documentation (2-3 days)

This phase ensures the quality and maintainability of the final product.

-   [ ] **5.1. Unit & Integration Testing:**
    -   Write unit tests for critical Rust backend logic (e.g., document parsing, API communication, data validation).
    -   Write component tests for key React UI components.

-   [ ] **5.2. User Documentation:**
    -   Create a simple `README.md` or user guide explaining how to install and use the application, including how to configure the AI tiers.

-   [ ] **5.3. Final Review:**
    -   Conduct a final review of the application against the PRD to ensure all requirements have been met.
