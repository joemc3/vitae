# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **containerized web application** for generating professional portfolio websites and targeted resumes from a user's document repository. Built with **Python** (FastAPI backend) + **React** (admin UI) + **Next.js** (site generation) + **PostgreSQL**, deployed via Docker Compose.

**Architecture**: 5 services in production — PostgreSQL, Python API, Admin App (Nginx + React), Next.js Generator, Public Sites (Nginx static).

## Product Model

Users build a **document repository** over time — uploading resumes, project descriptions, accomplishment summaries, certifications, and other professional documents. AI synthesizes a unified professional profile from this corpus and produces three output types:

1. **Portfolio site** — a long-lived public presence generated from the full document repository
2. **Targeted site** — generated for a specific job posting, shareable via URL (e.g. `resume.joe.com/abc123`)
3. **Targeted resume PDF** — generated for a specific job posting, downloadable for applications

The document repository is the core asset. Sites and resumes are views into it.

### Two Separate Surfaces

- **Public sites** — static HTML served by Nginx. No login, no admin links, no CMS hints. Just clean portfolio content.
- **Admin app** — React SPA for document management, profile editing, and site generation. Separate subdomain.

## Database

- Schema managed by Alembic migrations in `src-api/migrations/versions/`
- Migrations run automatically on API startup (via `alembic upgrade head` in the lifespan hook)
- **Current tables**: `users`, `documents`, `api_keys`, `profiles` (includes `photo_path` for uploaded profile photo), `job_postings`, `sites`, `resumes`

All tables use UUID primary keys and automatic timestamps.

To create a new migration:
```bash
cd src-api
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"
```

## Authentication Flow

1. User registers via `POST /api/auth/register` (email + password)
2. Password hashed with bcrypt and stored in PostgreSQL
3. User logs in via `POST /api/auth/login`
4. Server returns JWT token (24-hour expiration)
5. Frontend stores token in localStorage
6. Protected endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
7. `get_current_user` dependency validates JWT on each request

## Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for the full list. Key variables:

```
# Required
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=        # Database password
SECRET_KEY=               # Encryption key (32+ chars)
JWT_SECRET=               # JWT signing key (32+ chars)

# URLs (for CORS and link generation)
SITE_URL=                 # Public sites base URL (e.g. https://resume.joe.com)
ADMIN_URL=                # Admin app base URL (e.g. https://app.resume.joe.com)

# LLM providers (all optional)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
GEMINI_API_KEY=
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=
OLLAMA_URL=               # Default: http://localhost:11434

OUTPUT_DIR=               # Static file output (default: /data/output)
```

## Testing

- **Framework**: pytest + pytest-asyncio
- **Unit tests**: `tests/unit/` — fast, no external dependencies
- **Integration tests**: `tests/integration/` — uses `testcontainers` (spins up real PostgreSQL)
- **TDD is mandatory**: write failing test → implement → verify passing → commit

```bash
# Run unit tests (fast)
cd src-api && uv run pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Run integration tests (needs Docker)
cd src-api && uv run pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Run all tests
cd src-api && uv run pytest -v
```

## Development Workflow (superpowers)

This project uses the **superpowers workflow** for all non-trivial work:

1. **Brainstorm** — explore the problem space and user intent
2. **Spec** — write a design document in `docs/superpowers/specs/`
3. **Plan** — write a step-by-step implementation plan in `docs/superpowers/plans/`
4. **TDD** — write failing tests
5. **Implement** — make tests pass
6. **Review** — verify correctness before declaring done

Current design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-03-30-project-revival-design.md`

## Current Phase

**Project renamed to Vitae** (2026-04-09). Cross-cutting rename from "Professional Website Builder" landed on `main` as a standalone mini-phase ahead of Phase 3e-B. Touched the Python API package, Node packages, Docker Compose, Postgres identity, HKDF encryption salt, admin UI branding, and all docs. The working directory on disk is still `professional-website-builder/` until the user renames it manually — see the post-rename checklist below.

**Phase 3e-A (Polish Features) is complete.** Live preview system with two-tier approach (static theme showcase + SSR with real data), profile photo upload with Pillow resize, and conditional resume download link on portfolio sites. Admin UI includes theme gallery with screenshots, preview modal with iframe, and drag-and-drop photo upload on the profile page.

**Previous phases:**
- Phase 3d (Resume PDF Generation) — LLM-tailored resumes with WeasyPrint, 6 theme templates, two-pass page fitting
- Phase 3c (Theme Design) — 5 site themes with content primitives composition architecture
- Phase 3b (Admin UI) — full React admin app rebuild with shadcn/ui
- Phase 3a (Sites & Generator Wiring) — backend pipeline, job postings, site generation, public Nginx
- Phase 2b (Profile & Settings) — profile synthesis, API key management, document parsing

**Phase 3e-B (Deployment)** is next.

### Post-rename verification results

The rename was verified end-to-end in Docker: `/health` OK, all 8 tables in the `vitae` DB owned by `vitae`, JWT auth, document upload + ARQ worker parsing, profile PUT, and site-generation job dispatch. The one layer that could not be verified is the Node-based static site generator itself — see "Known pre-existing gap" below.

### Compose simplification (landed alongside the rename)

`docker-compose.yml` was collapsed from a "base services + dev overlay via `extends`" pattern to a flat set of dev-profile services. The original pattern was latently broken: `docker compose --profile dev up` on a fresh volume would race the base `postgres` and `postgres-dev` services both trying to initdb the same `postgres-data` volume. The base services were templates for a prod config that didn't exist yet and will be designed properly in Phase 3e-B. Current compose only defines `postgres-dev`, `redis-dev`, `api-dev`, `worker-dev`, `frontend-dev`, `public-sites-dev`, all on the `dev` profile. `docker compose --profile dev up --build -d` is the only supported command for now.

### Known pre-existing gap: generator not in worker container

`src-api/Dockerfile` does not install Node.js and does not copy `src-generator/`. The worker's site generation path (`site_generator.py` calls `node /app/generator/generate.js`) fails in-container with `No such file or directory: 'node'`. This is unrelated to the rename and was present before it. It likely means site generation has historically been run with the API/worker on the host (where Node and `src-generator` are accessible), not in Docker. Phase 3e-B should either:
- Install Node in the Dockerfile and copy `src-generator` in during build, or
- Build a separate generator image, or
- Document that site generation requires running the worker on the host.

### Post-rename manual steps

1. **Rename the working directory on disk.** The Docker Compose project name is derived from the directory name, so renaming the directory also gives the stack a fresh set of volumes under the `vitae_*` prefix.
   ```bash
   docker compose --profile dev down -v    # if anything is running
   cd ..
   mv professional-website-builder vitae
   cd vitae
   docker compose --profile dev up --build -d
   curl -sf http://localhost:8000/health   # expect {"status":"ok","database":"connected"}
   ```
2. **Optionally rename the GitHub repository and update the git remote URL:**
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin <new-url>
   ```
3. **Follow-up rewrite:** `src-ui/README.md` and `src-generator/README.md` were only *surgically* renamed in the Vitae rename pass. Both are still severely out of date (Tauri references, wrong ports, wrong features) and should be rewritten as a follow-up task.

## CRITICAL NOTES

### Security: .gitignore Maintenance

**Always check and update `.gitignore` when adding new frameworks, libraries, or components.** Ensure:
- `.env`, `.env.local` and similar are excluded
- API keys and secrets are never committed
- Framework artifacts excluded (`.next/`, `__pycache__/`, `node_modules/`, etc.)
- Docker runtime artifacts excluded (`docker-volumes/`, `postgres-data/`, etc.)

### Never Commit Secrets

- Never commit `.env`
- Parameterized queries only — SQLAlchemy handles this automatically
- Encryption keys must be randomly generated (see `.env.example` instructions)

### Agent Usage for Complex Tasks

When working on multi-step or specialized tasks, create agents with specific expertise. Use the Task tool with appropriate subagent types. Launch agents proactively, in parallel when tasks are independent.

## Troubleshooting

```bash
# View all service logs
docker compose --profile dev logs -f

# Check specific service
docker compose --profile dev logs api-dev

# Check API health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Access database shell
docker compose --profile dev exec postgres-dev psql -U vitae vitae

# Rebuild without cache
docker compose --profile dev build --no-cache
```
